* Installation steps
With Ubuntu you need to install nodejs with =nvm= (Node Version Manager).
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Refer to https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
# Open new terminal and check nvm command exists
command -v nvm
# Download, compile, install latest release of node
nvm install node
#+END_SRC

Henceforth the =npm= command should refer to the npm installed by =nvm=.
* Setting up Angular

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Install @angular/cli globally
npm install -g @angular/cli
# In new terminal init new app
ng new my-app
# Serve the application
cd my-app
ng serve --open
#+END_SRC
